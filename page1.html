    <h2>Medellín<h2>
   	<p>Medellín is the capital of Colombia’s mountainous Antioquia province. Nicknamed the “City of Eternal Spring” for its temperate weather, it hosts a famous annual Flower Festival.Medellin has been transformed. It’s now a vibrant destination for travelers seeking a culturally rich vacation. Medellin rises proudly from the belly of the Aburrá Valley, and its natural beauty makes a perfect setting for hiking, zip lining and horseback riding. Travel through lush jungle to Piedra de Penol, then climb the 740 steps to the top—a journey within a journey that rewards you with unforgettable views. Some things Medellín is known for is with convenience shops big-and-small with display cases of fried goods. Once you’ve become accustomed to the empanada (in Medellín, typically a fried pastry with beef and potatoes), buñuelo (round cheese fritter) and pastel de pollo (chicken pastry), go to the city’s best spots for culinary bliss.
