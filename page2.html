	<h2>Gold Museum<h2>
	<p>The Museum of Gold is an archaeology museum located in Bogotá, Colombia. It is one of the most visited touristic highlights in the country. The museum receives around 500,000 tourists per year.The Gold Museum is part of the great cultural network of the Bank of the Republic, which in Bogotá includes the large Luis Ángel Arango Library, music halls, the Botero Museum and several art galleries. In the regions, the bank operates cultural centers in 28 cities. Visitors to the Gold Museum find a rich permanent exhibit, composed of four large halls with detailed museology (renovated in 2008) and frequent special exhibits showing other aspects of the collection or highlighting the cultural patrimony of other countries such as Mexico and Canada or cultural groups such as North American Indigenous peoples or the emperors of China. But the museum is not just a building—it is a network.  Six permanent regional museums, all free of charge, showcase the collections and themes relative to the past and present of each region: the Tairona Gold Museum in Santa Marta, Zenú in Cartagena, Quimbaya in Armenia, Calima in Cali, Nariño in Pasto and an Ethnographic Museum in Leticia in the Amazon jungle.

    <h3>Salt Cathedral<h3>
	<p>Zipaquirá has long been known for its salt reserves, and pre-Colombian society mined the area for salt since around the 5th century BC. The city was named the ‘City of Whites’ by the Spanish, and ironically, the salt was later used to finance Bolivar and Nariño’s independence campaigns. The salt from Zipaquirá still makes up around 40% of Colombia’s salt exports today. Before entering the Zipaquira Salt cathedral, the first thing you see is the plaza of flags where you will find the sculpture of the Virgen de Guasá (meaning salt and water). She is the miners' patron saint and has a miner at her feet. In the Ceremonial Plaza you will see the Cardinal Cross, the mining monument, the bell tower and the fountains. The mine's lighting dazzles tourists. This underground attraction has received more than 13 million visitors from all around the world. Ten thousand foreign tourists and 40 thousand Colombian tourists go there every month. Its structure, a mix of precise engineering and interesting history, led it to be declared the First Wonder of Colombia on February 4, 2007. Attractions and features inside the mine
